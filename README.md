## Online appointment booking

Customers can schedule an appointment by choosing the time slot that suits them best. They will receive a booking confirmation, and closer to the date, a reminder for their appointment.

##  Self check-in

With the appointment reminder, the customer gets a link they can use for self check-in. Alternatively, they can also scan a QR code to get in the line. A mobile ticket will be issued after check-in.

## Arrival and service

A notification will be sent to customers when itâ€™s their turn to be served.
